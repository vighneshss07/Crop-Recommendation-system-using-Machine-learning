# Crop-Recommendation-system-using-Machine-learning

The Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning aims to assist farmers in making informed decisions about the most suitable crops to plant based on various environmental and soil factors. This system employs machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify and recommend the best crops. Additionally, linear regression is utilized for predicting crop yields. 

By analyzing data on soil composition, weather conditions, temperature, and historical crop performance, the system provides tailored recommendations to optimize agricultural productivity. This approach enhances decision-making, supports sustainable farming practices, and contributes to increased crop yields and profitability for farmers.
